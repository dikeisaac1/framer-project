# Animated Icon Transition (HTML, CSS, JS)
Overview: 
This project showcases an animated icon transition effect using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A set of icons displayed at the top of the page cycles through different icons (such as a sun, moon, and star) automatically every 3 seconds. The icons transition with a smooth fade effect, creating a visually appealing animation for web pages. This project draws inspiration from beginner tutorials for animating UI elements with vanilla web technologies.

Features: 
Icon Cycling: Automatically switches between icons (e.g., sun, moon, star) every 3 seconds.
Fade Transition: Icons fade in and out smoothly during transitions.
JavaScript Control: JavaScript handles the timing and logic for cycling through icons.
Responsive Design: Adjusts for different screen sizes with basic CSS media queries.
